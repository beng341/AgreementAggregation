This repository contains code used to run the experiments, and generate the figures, for the paper "Designing Rules to Pick a Rule: Aggregation by Consistency" from Emin Berker, Ben Armstrong, Vincent Conitzer, Nihar Shah".

The code is likely to be updated as we consider new experiments.
If you are interested in using this code for your work we would be happy to chat with you! We encourage you to reach out before using the code so we can provide any guidance that may be useful.



Our experiments were run using Python 3.11.9.
To use the code, please ensure that all packages listed in requirements.txt are installed.
Note that in addition to the packages that must be installed, we also include in our code the sdopt-tearing library, found at https://github.com/baharev/sdopt-tearing.
